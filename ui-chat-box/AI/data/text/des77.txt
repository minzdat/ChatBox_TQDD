Bringing it back to the OG pair. These shoes have the same knit pattern we used on the very first Ultraboosts from 2015. Although it carries the DNA of performance running, these trainers are built for the day-to-day. The adidas Primeknit upper has a supportive feel, and the Boost midsole offers comfort you'll have to feel to believe.
