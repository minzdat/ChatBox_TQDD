Same look. Same vibe. Different materials. The adidas Superstar Shoes have been in a continuous state of evolution since they debuted on the hardwood in the '70s. So it makes sense that as the world's needs change, so does the icon's intention. These shoes alone will not save the planet, and the side of the shoe will tell you exactly that. But they are made with recycled materials, natural and renewable rubber and a synthetic leather upper. And that's a good start.This product is made with Primegreen, a series of high-performance recycled materials. 70% of upper is recycled content. No virgin polyester.
