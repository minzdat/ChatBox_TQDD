How do you improve on a legend? The iconic Stan Smith sneaker shows the way forward. This version of the court classic has the same clean, crisp look as the original, but done in recycled materials. It's part of adidas' commitment to replacing all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in their products by 2024. It's not going to end plastic waste altogether, but it's a start. This product is made with Primegreen, a series of high-performance recycled materials. 50% of the upper is recycled content. No virgin polyester.
