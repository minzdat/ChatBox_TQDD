Does getting ready in the morning feel like packing for summer camp? No one else needs to know that. This adidas backpack looks refined enough to wear to work, and it holds enough to take you to the yoga studio and out with friends before you head home. Throw in your gym clothes, casual clothes and a water bottle. Tuck your phone in the media pocket so you can listen to your tunes between each stop.
