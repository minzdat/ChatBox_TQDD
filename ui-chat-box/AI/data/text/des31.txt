Basketball players create separation by cutting quicker, running faster and jumping higher than the competition. The ultra-lightweight Air Jordan XXXV Low helps transform your speed and power into linear and vertical separation. Similar to the inline game shoe, it uses a sculpted and stable midsole that's loaded with visible, large-volume Zoom Air units to help you exploit the space you create. The lower collar height allows ankle mobility while keeping you fully and comfortably contained. This PF version has an extra-durable outsole that's ideal for outdoor courts.Eclipse the CompetitionThe sculpted Eclipse plate 2.0 is raised along its upper edge to enhance side-to-side stability and support. It's hollowed out to reduce the shoe's overall weight while letting you see through the shoe.2x Visible ZoomZoom Air cushioning under the heel and forefoot has a springy, responsive feel. The large-volume heel unit provides impact cushioning, while the forefoot unit helps support your game. The edges of both units are visible through the hollow midsole plate.Lace Up, Lock InFlightwire cables stitched into the side radiate up from the curved plate. When you lace up they pull the material snugly over the sides and top of your foot to help keep you stable on the footbed.Traction and ControlThe rubber outsole uses a modified herringbone tread pattern that grips the court.
